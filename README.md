# Python Package for CITS algorithm: Causal Inference from Time Series data

CITS algorithm infers causal relationships in time series data based on structural causal model and Markovian condition of arbitrary but finite order. See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01920) for details.

## Installation

You can get the latest version of CITS package as follows.

`pip install cits`

To install from source instead, run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abbasilab/cits
cd cits
pip install .            # add the plotting helpers with: pip install ".[viz]"
```

**Typical install time.** About a minute or less on a desktop computer. A clean
install of the package and its dependencies (numpy, scipy, pandas, networkx)
took 12 to 16 s on a Linux server with a fast network connection. Most of that
time is spent downloading numpy and scipy. The optional GPU library (cuPC)
compiles in about 30 s (see "GPU setup (cuPC)").

This installs everything needed to run CITS on the CPU. No R and no GPU are
required to import `cits` or to run the default (partial-correlation)
conditional-independence test.

## System requirements

**Operating system.** Tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04, x86-64). The CPU code is
pure Python with no platform-specific parts, but macOS and Windows have not
been tested.

**Python.** Tested on Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.

**Dependencies.** These are installed automatically by `pip`. The table lists
the versions tested.

| Package | Tested versions |
|---|---|
| numpy | 1.26.4, 2.2.6, 2.5.3 |
| scipy | 1.13.1, 1.15.3, 1.18.1 |
| pandas | 2.3.3, 3.0.6 |
| networkx | 3.2.1, 3.4.2, 3.7 |
| matplotlib (optional, plotting) | 3.9.4, 3.10.9, 3.11.2 |
| torch (optional, `cits_rcit`) | 2.9.1 |

**Hardware.** No special hardware is needed for the CPU path. The demo below
uses about 110 MB of memory. The optional GPU backend needs an NVIDIA GPU and
the CUDA toolkit (`nvcc`) to build cuPC. It was tested on an NVIDIA RTX 5000
Ada (32 GB) with driver 535.261.03 and CUDA 12.2.

- **Optional, for the exact HSIC kernel test only.** R 4.0 or later with the
  `kpcalg` package, plus the Python `rpy2` bridge. Install the Python side
  with `pip install cits[hsic]`, and the R side in R or RStudio with

  ```
  > install.packages("BiocManager")
  > BiocManager::install("graph")
  > BiocManager::install("RBGL")
  > install.packages("pcalg")
  > install.packages("kpcalg")
  ```

  The partial-correlation test (the default) and RCIT need none of this.
  This optional path is not covered by the automated test suite.

- **Optional, recommended for large graphs (more than about 100 variables).**
  The cuPC GPU backend. See "GPU setup (cuPC)" below.


## How to run CITS

Every function below runs the same CITS algorithm. They differ in the
conditional-independence test, which you match to your data, and in the
search, which you match to the size of your graph and your sampling rate.

| Function | Test | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `cits.methods.cits_full` | partial correlation | small graphs with linear or approximately Gaussian data |
| `cits.cits_rcit` | RCIT kernel test | nonlinear or non-Gaussian data, such as spike counts |
| `cits.cits_gpu` | partial correlation | large graphs, up to thousands of variables, on a GPU |
| `cits.cits_contemporaneous` | partial correlation | slow sampling, such as calcium imaging, where same-time edges matter |

All functions take the time series `X` with shape `(p, T)` (p variables by
T time points) and return a `(p, p)` matrix whose entry `[i, j]` is the
inferred influence of variable `i` on variable `j`. `cits.run(X, method)`
dispatches by name, with `method` set to `'base'`, `'rcit'`, `'gpu'` or
`'contemporaneous'`.

### `cits.methods.cits_full`

The reference algorithm, with an exhaustive search over conditioning sets and
the partial-correlation test. It needs no GPU. The exhaustive search grows
quickly with the number of variables, so use it for small graphs of about four
to five variables.

```python
import numpy as np
from cits import methods

X = np.random.randn(4, 1000)                                  # (p, T)
adj = methods.cits_full(X, tau=1, alpha=0.05)                 # binary adjacency
adj, eff = methods.cits_full_weighted(X, tau=1, alpha=0.05)   # plus weighted effects
```

### `cits.cits_rcit`

The same exhaustive search with the randomized conditional-independence test
(RCIT, Strobl, Zhang and Visweswaran 2019), a fast random-Fourier-feature
approximation of the kernel (HSIC) test. Use it for nonlinear or non-Gaussian
data. The paper uses it for its nonlinear autoregressive and spiking-network
benchmarks. It runs on a CUDA GPU when one is available and on the CPU
otherwise, and gives the same graph on both.

Install the extra with `pip install cits[rcit]`, which adds PyTorch. If the
default PyTorch wheel targets a newer CUDA than your driver supports, PyTorch
warns and runs on the CPU. To match your driver, install PyTorch first from
https://pytorch.org, for example with
`pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`, or
`.../whl/cpu` for CPU only. The paper used torch 2.9.1 with CUDA 12.

```python
import cits

B = cits.cits_rcit(X, alpha=0.05, tau=1)   # (p, p) int lagged adjacency, self-lags included
```

`max_cond_size=None` (the default, as in the paper's benchmarks) searches
conditioning sets of every size. A smaller cap is faster on larger graphs.
`null='perm'` selects a NumPy-only permutation reference, which is slow but
needs no PyTorch.

### `cits.cits_gpu`

For large graphs. It replaces the exhaustive search with cuPC's
neighbor-restricted PC-stable search on the GPU. This recovers the same graph
under the faithfulness assumption CITS already makes. On one GPU it took about
33 s for 1,000 variables (500 samples) and about 3 h for 2,000 variables
(2,000 samples). The largest graph is set by GPU memory rather than run time.
A 5,000-variable run failed in cuPC on our 32 GB GPU. It uses the
partial-correlation test, infers lagged edges, and requires cuPC (see "GPU
setup (cuPC)" below).

```python
import cits

B_lag = cits.cits_gpu(X, alpha=0.05, tau=1)   # (p, p) int lagged adjacency
```

### `cits.cits_contemporaneous`

When sampling is slow relative to the interactions, many interactions fall
within a single sample and appear as same-time (contemporaneous) dependence.
This function adds a contemporaneous PC step to the lagged CITS search and
takes the union of lagged and contemporaneous parents. It then fits one set of
signed edge weights per target with a linear structural causal model, using
local IDA for edges whose direction is not identified. The paper uses it for
its calcium-imaging and Neuropixels analyses. It uses the partial-correlation
test and supports `tau=1`.

The `backend` argument is `'auto'` by default. It uses cuPC when available and
the CPU otherwise, and both give the same skeleton. cuPC is recommended above
about 100 variables.

```python
import cits

B = cits.cits_contemporaneous(X, alpha=0.05, tau=1)                 # backend='auto'
B = cits.cits_contemporaneous(X, alpha=0.05, tau=1, backend='cpu')  # no GPU needed
# B[parent, child] = signed weight; 0 = no edge; NaN = edge with unidentified sign

out = cits.cits_contemporaneous(X, alpha=0.05, tau=1, full_output=True)
# dict: 'weighted', 'skeleton', 'edge_type', 'sign_ambiguous', 'lagged', 'cpdag'
```

By default (`weight_lagged_only=False`) the output matches the paper's
analyses. Edges found only in the lagged search stay in the skeleton without a
weight. Set `weight_lagged_only=True` to also give those edges a least-squares
weight.

## Demo (quickstart)

A runnable end-to-end example on a small simulated dataset from the bundled
simulator (4 variables, 2,000 time points). No data download and no GPU needed.

```python
import numpy as np
import cits
from cits import methods, simulate_timeseries

# Simulate a small linear-Gaussian series: X is (p=4, T), plus ground truth.
X, gt_adj, gt_weighted = simulate_timeseries.simulate('lingauss1', noise=1.0, T=2000)
print(X.shape)          # (4, 2000)  -> p=4 variables, T=2000 time points

# 1) Base CITS (CPU): binary and weighted lagged adjacency.
adj = methods.cits_full(X, tau=1, alpha=0.05)             # (p, p) 0/1
adj_w, eff = methods.cits_full_weighted(X, tau=1, alpha=0.05)

# 2) Lagged + contemporaneous edges with signed weights (CPU here).
B = cits.cits_contemporaneous(X, alpha=0.05, tau=1, backend='cpu')

# 3) At scale, prefer the GPU lagged skeleton (needs cuPC):
# B_lag = cits.cits_gpu(X, alpha=0.05, tau=1)

# Read the result: entry [i, j] is the i -> j causal influence.
# For cits_full: 1 = edge, 0 = no edge.
# For cits_contemporaneous: signed beta = edge weight, 0 = no edge,
#   NaN = edge present but sign-ambiguous (no identifiable weight).
parents_of_2 = np.where(adj[:, 2] != 0)[0]
print("inferred causes of variable 2:", parents_of_2)   # expect {0, 1} for lingauss1
```

**Run it.** Save the code above as `quickstart.py` and run `python quickstart.py`.

**Expected output.**

```
(4, 2000)
inferred causes of variable 2: [0 1]
```

In the simulated system, variables 0 and 1 drive variable 2 (ground-truth edges
0 → 2, 1 → 2 and 2 → 3), so CITS recovers the true causes of variable 2.

**Expected run time.** Under a minute, about 50 s on a single CPU core
(measured on an Intel Xeon Gold 6430, and a typical desktop is similar), using
about 110 MB of memory. If cuPC is installed, the commented `cits_gpu` line
returns the same causes, `[0 1]`, in about 10 s, most of which is one-time CUDA
start-up. For larger graphs, the paper's benchmark (random sparse
linear-Gaussian graphs, one GPU) runs 1,000 variables in about 33 s with 500
samples and about 61 s with 1,000.

### Running CITS on your own data

1. Arrange the recording as a NumPy array `X` of shape `(p, T)`, with one row
   per variable (for example, a neuron) and one column per time point. Values
   must be finite, and `cits` raises an error on NaN.
2. Choose `tau`, the maximum interaction delay in time bins (`tau=1` is the
   default and is what the paper uses), and the significance level `alpha`.
3. Pick the function from the table in "How to run CITS".
4. Read the result. Entry `[i, j]` is the inferred influence of variable `i` on
   variable `j`.

### One entry point with `cits.run`

`cits.run(X, method, **kwargs)` dispatches by name, with `method` one of
`'base'`, `'gpu'`, `'contemporaneous'` or `'rcit'`. Keyword arguments pass
straight through to the underlying function.

```python
adj = cits.run(X, 'base', tau=1, alpha=0.05)          # -> methods.cits_full
B_lag = cits.run(X, 'gpu', tau=1)                      # -> cits_gpu
B = cits.run(X, 'contemporaneous', backend='cpu')      # -> cits_contemporaneous
B = cits.run(X, 'rcit')                                # -> cits_rcit
```

### Plotting (optional)

With the `viz` extra installed (`pip install cits[viz]`), draw the graph or
its adjacency in the paper's style. Grouping is optional.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Basic: just pass the adjacency.
cits.plot_graph(B)
cits.plot_matrix(B)
plt.show()
```

If you have node labels or groups (for example brain regions or cell types),
pass `groups` for a clustered layout, per-group colors, side-strips and a
legend.

```python
groups = {0: 'src', 1: 'src', 2: 'mid', 3: 'sink'}
cits.plot_graph(B, labels=['a','b','c','d'], groups=groups)
cits.plot_matrix(B, labels=['a','b','c','d'], groups=groups)
plt.savefig('graph.png', bbox_inches='tight')   # legend sits outside the axes
```

`plot_graph` draws directed edges as curved arcs, reciprocal pairs as a single
double-headed arc, and edge width proportional to the absolute weight. With
`groups`, it lays nodes out in per-group clusters colored by group.
`plot_matrix` renders the adjacency as a `matshow` heatmap (diverging `bwr`).
By default its symmetric color scale is set by a high percentile of the
absolute weights, so faint edges stay visible. Pass `vmin=-0.1, vmax=0.1` for a
fixed scale. It adds group side-strips when `groups` is given. Both functions
raise a clear error telling you to `pip install cits[viz]` if matplotlib is
missing, and `import cits` never needs matplotlib.

Grouping is most legible for up to about 10 to 12 groups. Up to six groups get
a shaded hue family each, and beyond that each group gets a distinct solid
color. There is no hard limit. For full control over many groups, pass
`group_colors={label: color}`.

## Which method should I use?

Start from the table in "How to run CITS". The practical limits are as follows.

- **`cits.methods.cits_full`.** The exhaustive search grows quickly with the
  number of variables. p=4 with T=2000 takes about 25 s on one CPU core, and
  p=5 with T=3000 took about 20 min. For more variables, use `cits_gpu` or
  `cits_contemporaneous`.
- **`cits.cits_rcit`.** Each test is slower than a partial-correlation test.
  It is practical for small to moderate graphs and faster on a GPU. Lower
  `max_cond_size` to trade search depth for speed.
- **`cits.cits_gpu`.** Needs an NVIDIA GPU and cuPC. It scales to thousands of
  variables, limited by GPU memory.
- **`cits.cits_contemporaneous`.** The CPU is fine for small to moderate
  graphs. cuPC is recommended above about 100 variables.

The 100-variable figure is a practical guideline, not a hard rule, so
benchmark your own setup.

## Choosing parameters

- **`tau` (Markov order, or maximum lag).** The number of time steps over which
  one variable can influence another. Use `tau=1` when the interaction delay
  is about one time bin (the paper's setting for 10 ms neural bins). Larger
  `tau` captures longer-lag dependencies but costs statistical power. Pick
  `tau` from the known interaction timescale or the autocorrelation of your
  data. `cits_contemporaneous` currently supports `tau=1` only.
- **`alpha` (significance level of each test).** Controls sparsity. The
  default is `0.05`. A lower value (`0.01`) gives a sparser, more conservative
  graph, and a higher value (`0.1`) gives a denser, more sensitive one. Check
  stability across `{0.01, 0.05, 0.1}`.
- **Time bins and sampling.** Finer bins resolve directionality better but give
  fewer counts per bin and less power, and they can break Gaussianity, in which
  case use `cits_rcit`. Bins coarser than the interaction delay push effects
  into the same time slice, in which case use `cits_contemporaneous`. The paper
  used 10 ms bins for spike data.
- **Conditional-independence test.** Partial correlation is fast and suits
  approximately linear or Gaussian data. RCIT (`cits_rcit`) suits nonlinear or
  non-Gaussian data. `cits_full` also accepts `cond_dep='cond_dep_hsic'`, an
  exact kernel test that needs R and `kpcalg`, of which RCIT is a faster
  approximation.
- **`backend` (for `cits_contemporaneous`).** Use `'cpu'` for small to moderate
  graphs and `'cupc'` above about 100 variables. `'auto'` picks cuPC when it is
  available.
- **Reproducible graphs.** For a robust graph, run over multiple independent
  windows and keep edges that appear in a high fraction of them. The paper
  retained edges present in at least 90% of non-overlapping 90 s windows. The
  90% figure is a practical guideline, not a hard rule.

## GPU setup (cuPC)

cuPC is the **recommended backend for large graphs**, above about 100
variables as a practical guideline. It is **optional**. `cits_gpu` requires
it, but base CITS, `cits_rcit` and `cits_contemporaneous` with the CPU backend
run with no GPU at all, and `backend='auto'` selects the CPU automatically when
no GPU is present.

The GPU path calls [cuPC](https://github.com/LIS-Laboratory/cupc) (Zarebavani
et al. 2020) for the Fisher-z skeleton search. Its compiled shared library
`Skeleton.so` is a GPU/CUDA build, is not on PyPI, and is licensed separately
under cuPC's own GPL-3.0 license. It is therefore **not bundled** with this
package and is **not** in `install_requires`.

You need a CUDA-capable GPU and the CUDA toolkit (`nvcc`). Build `Skeleton.so`
once from the cuPC source.

```
git clone https://github.com/LIS-Laboratory/cupc
cd cupc
nvcc -O3 --shared -Xcompiler -fPIC -o Skeleton.so cuPC-S.cu
```

### Telling the package where `Skeleton.so` is

Point the package to the directory that contains `Skeleton.so` in either of
two ways.

```
export CUPC_DIR=/path/to/cupc          # environment variable
```

```python
import cits
cits.set_cupc_dir("/path/to/cupc")     # checks the path and remembers it
```

`set_cupc_dir` remembers the location across sessions, so you only do this
once. If neither is set, the package checks a few default locations such as
`./cupc` and, in an interactive terminal, asks once for the path. `import cits`
never looks for cuPC, so everything except the GPU backend works without it.

**Citation for cuPC** (`zarebavani2020cupc`). Zarebavani, B., Jafarinejad, F.,

Distributed Systems*, 31(3), 530-542.

## What you'll see and troubleshooting

- **Backend notice.** The first `cits_contemporaneous` run in a process emits
  one line through the `cits` logger (stderr by default) saying which backend
  it chose and why.
  - `cits: using cuPC GPU backend.` means `backend='auto'` found a working cuPC.
  - `cits: cuPC not found; using the CPU backend (fine up to ~100 variables;
    see README 'GPU setup' to enable GPU acceleration).` means `auto` fell back
    to the CPU for a small graph.
  - For a CPU run above about 100 variables (explicit `backend='cpu'`, or
    `auto` with no cuPC) the message is `cits: contemporaneous CITS on CPU with
    p=NN variables may be slow; the CPU skeleton search scales steeply with p.
    In our scaling benchmark the cuPC GPU backend inferred p=1000-variable
    graphs in ~33 s. The GPU backend is recommended above ~100 variables (see
    README).`

  It prints at most once per process. Silence such notices with
  `export CITS_QUIET=1`. Warnings still show.

- **Controlling verbosity (logging).** All messages go through the standard
  logger `logging.getLogger('cits')`. Raise its level to quiet things down, or
  add your own handler to capture them.

  ```python
  import logging
  logging.getLogger('cits').setLevel(logging.WARNING)  # hide info notices
  logging.getLogger('cits').setLevel(logging.ERROR)    # hide warnings too
  ```

  With no logging configured, notices and warnings appear on stderr.

- **CPU vs GPU.** The CPU backend works everywhere and is fine for small to
  moderate graphs. Above about 100 variables the CPU skeleton search slows
  steeply with p, and the cuPC GPU backend is much faster. The paper's scaling
  benchmark inferred 1,000-variable graphs in about 33 s on cuPC.
  `backend='auto'` picks cuPC when it is available.

- **Input validation.** `cits_full`, `cits_gpu` and `cits_contemporaneous`
  check `X` up front. `X` must be 2D with shape `(p variables, T timepoints)`.
  NaN or inf raises a clear error. A transposed-looking array (p > T) warns.
  Constant or all-zero variable rows warn with the offending indices, because
  partial correlation is undefined on constant series.

- **cuPC call failed at runtime.** If cuPC loads but the GPU call errors (a
  driver or CUDA mismatch, no visible GPU, or out of memory), the behaviour
  depends on the backend.
  - Under `backend='auto'` you see the warning
    `cits: cuPC GPU call failed (<reason>); falling back to the CPU backend.
    See README 'GPU setup'.` and the run continues on the CPU.
  - Under explicit `backend='cupc'` the call re-raises with
    `cits: cuPC GPU call failed (<reason>). Fix your cuPC/CUDA setup or rerun
    with backend='cpu'.` There is no silent fallback.

- **Progress for long runs.** Pass `verbose=True` to print short stage markers
  to stderr, `[cits contemporaneous] 1/4 lagged skeleton (p=NN)`,
  `2/4 contemporaneous PC`, `3/4 union` and `4/4 LSCM refit`.

- **`tau>1` with `cits_contemporaneous`.** Raises a clear error, because the
  union step supports `tau=1` only. Use `cits_gpu(X, tau=...)` for lagged
  inference at higher lags.

## Running the tests

```bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest test
```

Tests that need cuPC or a GPU are skipped automatically. `test_paper_repro.py`
also needs the authors' local benchmark data and is skipped elsewhere.
