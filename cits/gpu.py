cits.gpu

GPU-accelerated CITS: the faithful scalable CITS-lag skeleton.

Matches the exact CITS algorithm (``cits.methods.cits_full`` with
``cond_dep='cond_dep_pcorr'``) on every axis EXCEPT the conditioning-set
search, which is replaced by the neighbor-restricted, increasing-size PC
search (cuPC on GPU). That single substitution is sound under the
faithfulness assumption CITS already requires: a valid separating set is
guaranteed to lie within the adjacency set, so the powerset traversal is
redundant and cuPC recovers the same skeleton under the oracle.

Matched to exact CITS:
  - NON-overlapping windows (as in cits.methods.data_transform), not overlapping.
  - Window width w = 2*(tau+1) and time-major layout c = t*p + v
    (identical to data_transform / cits_unrolled indexing).
  - Full initial adjacency -> conditioning pool is the whole window, exactly
    as in the CITS powerset (which conditions on all window variables).
  - Targeted extraction of lag edges into the present slice t = 2*tau+1 from
    source slices t1 in {tau+1, ..., 2*tau}, oriented by time -- identical to
    cits_unrolled's tested edge set and cits_rolled's collapse.

Only remaining difference from cits_full(pcorr): powerset conditioning ->
neighbor-restricted increasing-size search (cuPC, capped at level 14).

Requires a compiled cuPC ``Skeleton.so`` and a CUDA-capable GPU. See
``cits._cupc_wrapper`` (and the README "GPU setup (cuPC)" section) for the
``CUPC_DIR`` environment variable and build instructions.

        convention as ``cits.methods.cits_full``.
    alpha : float
        Significance level for the Fisher-z partial-correlation test.
        Default 0.05.
    tau : int
        CITS Markovian order / maximum lag. Default 1 (paper default).
    max_level : int
        Max conditioning-set size passed to cuPC (compiled cap ML=14).

        slice; 0 otherwise. Lagged (directed-in-time) edges only, no
        contemporaneous structure. Same contract as the source
